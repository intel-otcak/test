Subject: [PATCH 12/22] FOR_UPSTREAM [VPG]: drm/i915: Change sleep to delays
 for DPCD ops

DPCD operations are time sensitive and using sleep based calls such
as msleep results in some calls taking upto 10ms to be returning.
Hence this patch changes such calls in the dpcd path to
usleep_range. this will guarantee that the required delay is
satisfied and will also ensure that we continue normal
processing immediately after this delay.
